The objective of this project is to design and develop a smart vacuum cleaner, that will help to make household work convenient and much easier. In this project new type of home intelligent cleaner adopted the ultrasonic sensor, which has the function of real-time environment perception, is introduced, and this cleaner driven by a dc motor has the ability of autonomous working by itself and functions of automatic detection and obstacle avoidance.

Obstacle Avoidance: --> Perception through 3 Ultrasonic Sensors

Vacuum Cleaner: --> Implemented by using Bernoulli's Principle, which states that as the speed of air increases, the pressure decreases. Air will always flow from a high-pressure area to a low-pressure area, to try to balance out the pressure.
